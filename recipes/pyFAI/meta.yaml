  summary: 'Python implementation of fast azimuthal integration'

  description: |
    pyFAI is an azimuthal integration library that tries to be fast (as fast
    as C and even more using OpenCL and GPU). It is based on histogramming of
    the 2theta/Q positions of each (center of) pixel weighted by the intensity
    of each pixel, but parallel version uses a SparseMatrix-DenseVector
    multiplication. Neighboring output bins get also a contribution of pixels
    next to the border thanks to pixel splitting. Finally pyFAI provides also
    tools to calibrate the experimental setup using Debye-Scherrer rings of a
    reference compound.
